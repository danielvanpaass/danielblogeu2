										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Very tired from our outdoor adventure of climbing the Gunung Gede, we continued to the last city of the trip, Jakarta. The first thing on our mind was healing our sore muscles from the climb with a massage, a very difficult and unsuccessful endeavor, it turns out. In this city we would visit two companies, a very big one and one that is more of a startup. Furthermore, we did a lot of cultural exploring. The Istiqlal Mosque is the biggest one in Southeast Asia and a beautiful place to see! We also visited the Christian church of Jakarta and I was told that the church and the mosque capacities often were shared in moments of need (such as parking spaces on certain days). </p>

<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">During our time exploring Indonesian cuisine, we indulged in a spectrum of flavorsâ€”from fiery, spicy dishes to more familiar delicacies like poffertjes, enriching our taste buds along the way.</p>

<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade"> In this city, we used Grab (the app for cheap uber rides and more) to its fullest. We found out that there is an option for going on a grab scooter, and enjoy the ride with the thrill of the ride style of the Grab drivers. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">The first city of the last country that was on our study visit: Bandung. We were mainly here to visit the ITB (Institut Teknologi Bandung). The students showing us the university were lovely and prepared a very nice talk for us when we arrived. This city surprised me in so many ways, however. We interacted very well with a lot of local people and that also got me into learning some words in Indonesian. We as foreign people were also quite famous! I had the celebrity experience of people wanting to take pictures with or of us, and children running up to me. </p>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">The first night that we arrived we looked for a beer house since getting beers at any food place would be difficult (it&#8217;s less popular in Java). This turned out easier than expected! </p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/At-a-beer-house-768x1024-640x480.jpg" title="At a beer house" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Some of us also followed a tour guide in Bandung, he took us through very interesting places and told us about the history of Bandung and Indonesia. Whilst waiting for our food, at a place where we ourselves would not have gotten without a tour guide (it was very hidden), Max and I played a 5v5 of football with some of the local kids. I obviously had the better team and we would not let Max win. This was a genuine and very enjoyable interaction, and also one of the reasons why Indonesia is my personal favorite of the trip. When the food was ready, we sat down of the floor with our tour guide to eat (after taking our shoes off).</p>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">In preparation of the hike on Gunung Gede, We also got a bit of parkour/cardio in by visiting the Rainbow Waterfall.</p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Beautiful-view-of-the-Citarum-River-1024x576-640x480.jpg" title="Beautiful view of the Citarum River" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Almost the entire study visit group dared to take on the challenge of climbing the Gunung Gede, Indonesian for &#8220;Big Mountain&#8221;.  An adventure that started by leaving somewhat after midnight from our hotel to the mountain by bus. Our guides helped us by bringing food for us up the mountain, and carrying up the tents for the first stop. They would each carry around 20 KG(!) up the mountain. So the challenge was already a bit easier on us than could have been, but very hard nonetheless! The first day we chilled at the hot springs close to the first stop, and slept early. The day after we would wake up and leave around 2-3 AM, to be able to catch the sunrise at the top of the mountain. Climbing with a big group is hard, and there&#8217;s a lot of waiting on each other. This led us to miss the sunrise by a small margin, but the views were still incredible! For me personally, I enjoyed the hike a lot and was very grateful to be a part of it. Having random people from Indonesia wanting to take a picture with me on top of that mountain was definitely a funny bonus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Singapore, the country where everything is forbidden. Before entering, we found out that there are a plethora of strict laws in place, that might even mean jail or the death sentence. Drugs were extremely forbidden, but fake cigarettes too (e-cigarette for example). Everyone seems to have a job here, and the streets are extremely clean (chewing gum is also forbidden). </p>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">On the first day we arrived in the afternoon to stash our bags in the hostel upon arrival. That same evening we went to the gardens by the bay shopping mall to go to the casino.</p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-does-my-watch-say-1024x768-640x480.jpg" title="What does my watch say" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Also in Singapore we enjoyed the delicious cuisine that was offered to us, although the type of food was similar to what we could get in Kuala Lumpur. There were less outdoor food stands here however. The dinner location for the first night was organized by the committee, at a food court. A place where different food stands were placed around shared dining places, you could get a tray with food at whichever cuisine you wanted and still eat together. </p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/A-food-stand-at-the-food-court-1024x768-640x480.jpg" title="A food stand at the food court" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">We also saw a lot of nature here, we did a trip to the botinical garden and took beautiful pictures there. There was also the more adventourus plan by Lieke, Max and Gina to do a mini hike (part of the Macritchie treetop trail). Remember how you shouldn&#8217;t have food out when there&#8217;s monkeys around? Apparently they can be quite hidden, poor Stan lost his only lunch option that day.  Afterwards we went to Palau Ibun to rent bikes and see mangrove trees. This Palau Island had ferries going there, and luckily we had enough cash for the outward journey! <a href="https://emojipedia.org/person-facepalming"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f926.png" alt="ðŸ¤¦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p>

<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">We visited a Chinese opera, which was very interesting but also very difficult to appreciate a lot since I had not seen something similar in my life before. We had a company visit to a quantum startup event, which was hosted at the Microsoft experience center. Another fun activity I did was visiting the flower dome at gardens by the bay, which had sections divided as the different continents, and then vegetation of each specific continent there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">I expected to have a culture shock as big as the one that I experienced when I went to the USA for my exchange. Even though this is indeed what I saw, it was less than I expected, probably because of the fact that we brought a part of NL with us (the 31 other people). Kuala Lumpur is a vibrant, warm, and diverse city. We were told of the local customs, of for example wearing long pants or pointing with the thumb instead of index finger out of respect. We resided in a hotel and could explore the city from there using cheap Uber rides (with the app called Grab). </p>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">One of the places we went to was the Batu Caves, where I rock-climbed with some others and saw a beautiful Indian temple. Here we also found a lot of monkeys. The only thing you&#8217;d have to watch out for is having food out in the open.</p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Climbing-the-Batu-Cave-1-577x1024-640x480.jpg" title="Climbing-the-Batu-Cave-1" alt="" /></div></div>



<p>We also visited a company called Juristech, they showed us around and had organized a delicious lunch for us to try the Malay cuisine.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group has-light-bg aos-fade is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:30%"></div>
</div>
</div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">On the topic of food, it was clear to me that I had to quickly adapt to enjoy spice (normally I don&#8217;t even put sambal on my dÃ¶ner). But all Malay/Indian/Asian cuisine was very nice. Food was also a hot topic to talk about with the locals I quickly discovered.</p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ordered-Malay-Kebab-at-the-food-court-1-1024x577-640x480.jpg" title="Ordered Malay Kebab at the food court" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">I also enjoyed the sights and food/drinks to try at China Town. The cocktails were as expensive as they would be in Delft.</p>



<div class="wp-block-envira-envira-gallery has-light-bg aos-fade"><div class="envira-gallery-feed-output"><img decoding="async" class="envira-gallery-feed-image" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/On-a-bridge-in-China-Town-1-577x1024-640x480.jpg" title="On-a-bridge-in-China-Town-1" alt="" /></div></div>



<p class="has-light-bg aos-fade">Two days before leaving to Singapore, we also visited the butterfly dome in Kuala Lumpur, where many beautiful pictures were taken. Also, we managed to try out the monorail, which was spectacular. The receipt for the ride however was denied when we tried to reimburse it (as public transport costs of the trip), very weird if you ask me.</p>
